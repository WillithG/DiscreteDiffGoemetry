## 2.3 Simplical surfaces
def simplical surface as pure simplical 2-complex, st the link of every vertex is a path / loop.
Or st the star of every vertex is a combinatorial disk made out of triangles

we will take for granted that our surfaces can be assigned a consistent orientation
(see the mobius band for a discussion of this subtlety)
